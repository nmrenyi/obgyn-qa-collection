# WHB Subset

A curated evaluation dataset for assessing large language models (LLMs) in women’s health–related tasks. The dataset consists of model stumps paired with expert-written justifications describing observed errors.

The dataset was developed in collaboration with women’s health experts, including clinicians, pharmacists, and researchers. The model stumps represent realistic prompts drawn from:
- Patient-facing scenarios  
- Clinician decision-making contexts  
- Evidence-based medical questions  

Each prompt is paired with an expert justification explaining the identified issue.

## Dataset Description

## Dataset Statistics

- **Model stumps:** 20
