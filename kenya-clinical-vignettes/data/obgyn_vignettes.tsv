7	I am a nurse with 4 years of experience in General nursing working in a Sub-county Hospitals and Nursing Homes in Kakamega county in Kenya.  I was just 20 years old. I brought a child for the first immunisation, that is at 6 weeks. The child was born at 3.3 kgs, but unfortunately when she was bringing the child for the immunisations, the child had dropped up to 2.2 kgs.  Now the mother looked stressed. Upon interrogation, she said that at home the mum is giving her stress, she is not giving her food, blaming her for the pregnancy and delivery because she was still at school. Now that situation confused me because I was wondering should I continue with the immunisations, should I refer the child for nutritional review or how will I help the mother.  Now that she has a new delivery case, no food is being provided by the mother, and I was just confused on what to do. Should I begin with the immunisations, should I refer for further management, should I refer for nutritional review, and how will I help the mother now that at her home the mother doesn't want to see her. When I shared it, I was wondering whether I should issue the immunisation first, or she should just seek nutritional review first and then come for immunisation later.  I wished I could get someone to give me those answers.	Summary 20 yr old mother concerned of dropping weight of the baby from 3.3 at birth to 2.2 kgs at 6 weeks She complains of stress and poor social support Key concerns i. Severe acute malnutrition ii.

139	I am a nurse working in a Sub-county Hospitals and Nursing Homes in Kiambu county in Kenya.  A patient who comes in with complaints of on and off infection, excessive urination, excessive intake of water, general body malaise, and the signs have been there for so long and fortunately or unfortunately she has not been attending our ANC clinic. She was attending somewhere where she was directed to do some of the tests, like urinalysis. It's a whole package of ANC profiles where it includes urinalysis and RBS and she had not done them.  And her assumptions were for the above signs, like for the urinalysis, for the frequent urination, it's because the baby is big, so the baby is pressing the bladder, so there is no space for the baby. So, I've said that those signs have been for so long, she couldn't trace the exact date. So, the assessment we did, all the investigations we did were urinalysis, a basic of urinalysis and blood pressure and an RBS.  And urinalysis just revealed glucose, glucose++++, that is four pluses, and an RBS which was basically high because it was around 34.5. And leukocytes, that is infection, she had a little bit of infection and the first thing you do, you inform the mother of the findings and how you're going to go about it so that you can do the management or you can handle the management in the ward. And the challenging part was with most of these high blood sugars, you just don't do oral because the effectiveness of the absorption will be minimal compared to injections and intravenous. So, I was in a situation where the patient had assumptions or myths and misconceptions about insulin injection.  And also, she couldn't be into terms like she has high sugars because the impression, the diagnosis at that moment was hyperglycemia in pregnancy or diabetes in pregnancy. And so, basically, after a while, we did the calculations after she consented. But for the calculations, I had to ask for guidance on how to calculate and the amount of fluids to give because I noticed...  So, the guidance was because I was in a state where I couldn't tell how to... I had an idea of it is normal saline and insulin, but what amount, the amount of insulin and in which relation do I do in body weight, what are the parameters I'm supposed to use to get the exact dosage of the amount of insulin I'm supposed to give. The other thing I noticed after the initiation of giving that calculated amount, the sugars drastically dropped.  So, what next, I actually asked for another guidance on what I'm supposed to do because when you get an instant drop of that sugar, it comes to around 12. What am I supposed to do to make it tipper down slowly to avoid a complication because a drastic drop could lead to further damage rather than your good intentions. And another thing, because normal saline, it has sodium, so I noticed that the blood pressure was kind of misbehaving.  So, what, like, in place of normal saline, is there any other crystaline or whatever fluids I'm supposed to replace in, in cases where, like, I asked for guidance, is there another fluid I'm supposed to replace in place of normal saline where I have a blood pressure which is misbehaving? Yeah. So, the questions I had... So, I've written three so far. What questions, what are the options in cases where patients wouldn't want to get their IVs and they are also the IV insulin or IV anti-diabetes or they don't want to be compliant with, not even they don't want, they have poor compliance with oral drugs.  What are the options?	summary: Patient comes in with excessive urination, excessive intake of water, hasn’t been attending clinic, is in pregnancy. Urinalysis reveal glucose++ . She was in denial.

She gives history of abnormal vaginal bleeding. She wants which method she can use.  She told me that she has been using emergency pills on and off. Because the husband wants the kid and she herself doesn't want the kid at that time. Because the husband is a KDF and he is a Somali and he wants to get pregnancy when the husband is around.  So that's the time he is taking the emergency pills on and off. So, I made a diagnosis because she had given me that she is having abnormal bleeding on and off. I made a diagnosis of hormonal imbalance because emergency pills you are not supposed to be using as a method of family planning.  You are supposed to use it in times of emergency like rape. So, I gave that information and then I told her that you are supposed to balance the hormones. So that that hormonal imbalance will cease.  So, the question which I would ask the expert is, If you are in a pill, it's being misused. What else can we help the community? What else can we use in place of emergency pills? Because it's there for the emergency but it's being misused.

One year, two months, or four months. It has a history of diarrhea, vomiting, sunken fontanelle, the anterior fontanelle.  Diarrhea, vomiting, refusal to breastfeed, and instability for the past two days. Diarrhea has been increasing with the time. also, the vomiting.  When the baby refused to breastfeed, she tried to feed something like yogurt to entice the baby, but the baby could not retain anything. So, on assessment, the baby has sunken fontanelle, and also the temperature was at 40 degrees Celsius, and then also the skin itch was greater than 3 seconds, and a diagnosis of severe dehydration was made. So, I advised the mother to first expose the baby, because the baby was heavily dressed, to remove the clothing, and the baby to be just left with a diaper, and maybe on the upper body, to be just left like that, or with a vest.  An IV access was done, and was fixed, and a stool sample was taken to the lab. And we were waiting for the results. The guidance I was asking from the doctor.  So, we are requesting for the right protocol on fluid infusion to avoid overload.  Then also, the treatment for the baby, since the baby has diarrhea, the right treatment for the baby, since the baby has diarrhea, and I understand that things like penicillin do not go hand-in-hand with people who are diarrhearing, or have vomiting. Actually, the right IV treatment for the baby. Then also, the question I have for that scenario is, I'm torn in between whether to first manage the dehydration, or to manage the fever.  Then also, when the results came, it detected that there were traces of AMOEBA, and the age is minimal, so I'm left to ask for the best advice to give to the mother, because she's the one who's handling the food for the baby. The best advice on food hygiene, and also the best way to give information, so as not to put it on her, like she's the causative agent to this diarrhea and vomiting.

So, a client who is Para 1+0 gravida 2 in her second pregnancy comes into the facility with complaints of headache, light headache, blood vision and epigastric pain that is very severe. And also, she had a, you could say, edema of the face. Then, she is a known-hypertensive patient.  She has been on follow-up due to high BP in pregnancy in the gynecology, we call it in GOPC. So, when she comes in, the BP is 180/120, with a pulse of 96. And she had been using methyldopa at 250 mg and nifedipine 20 mg.  So, we do a repeat of methyldopa. And because the nifedipine, she had taken it at, like she had not taken nifedipine, she had already taken only methyldopa. We added methyldopa at 250 and we gave a start of nifedipine at 20 mg.  Then, we do a rapid urinalysis where it determines ketones and proteins, four classes of proteins. And the ketones, they were just two. And we do a basic management.  We impress, pre-eclampsia pregnancy. Then, we usually take them to maternity where an IV of magnesium sulfate is given at 14 g. And also, after the immunization of magnesium sulfate, a repeat BP is done. And it is determined to be at around 168/109.  Then, after four hours, a repeat of the maintenance of magnesium sulfate is done. And the blood pressure drastically falls to 130/70. So, when the BP drops, the patient complains of dizziness, drastic dizziness while sitting.  So, we call to inquire and we get the management of whatever we have done and we are concerned of the BP. And we were told, one, you cannot give IV fluids. Whatever you are supposed to do is too many to keep on monitoring the BP.  So, the question I have for that, one, did the BP, did the blood... Did the blood pressure fall because of the maintenance? So, that is your question? Yeah. You are done with the assessment? The assessment and I am called to request as to for the... Okay. I am done with the assessment. . Did the blood pressure drastically fall from 168 /109 to 130 /70 after administration of magnesium sulfate, the maintenance dose. And the response was to keep on monitoring the BP.  Okay. So, what kept me wondering is the question I had. Did the BP fall because of the magnesium sulfate maintenance dose? And then in cases where you are managing preeclampsia and the BP falls, like it falls, because there is a certain rhythm it is supposed to fall in.  So, if it falls beyond whatever is expected, beyond 20 of the diastolic, like should I continue with the magnesium sulfate or should I continue with the antihypertensive or which of the drugs am I supposed to omit and continue with the other one? Should I continue with magnesium sulfate? Should I continue with magnesium sulfate or should I continue with the antihypertensives?

156	I am a nurse working in a Sub-county Hospitals and Nursing Homes in Kiambu county in Kenya.  So, a mother comes in company of neighbors and holding her baby, screaming. And the baby had oozing weetabix from the nose and from the mouth. They were feeding the baby and they reported that at an instant, the baby refused to take the weetabix and they forcibly gave the baby.  And the baby choked, so they came running. And we hurriedly went to the coach in the improvised casualty. And the baby was actually gasping, plus now the oozing weetabix.  And on assessment, an impression of weetabix aspiration was made. So the immediate action was actually sanctioning with an improvised sanction tube and a syringe. And also, when a CPR or the chest compression were initiated, more weetabix could come from the chest.  And because it was just a short duration intervention, luckily the consultant, no, not the consultant, the clinic officer was there. But we were calling in for guidance on whether to continue with the sanctioning or we continue with the chest compressions. Because they say immediately when we receive our baby, when they are choking or they are having an aspiration, when you start with the aspiration, you start with the sanctioning.  But in such a case, you only sanction whatever you see. But whenever you are doing the chest compression, you could realize that now the content was oozing. Like they were coming out in a great number rather than when we were sanctioning.  And so that is why we had called for the guidance. And also we called even for the guidance to be told on the necessary treatment there we can give. I guess it was a short duration.  So the next part was the question bit. Because definitely the baby didn't make it after the small time intervention. Sorry, go to the questions.  Yeah. Like it kept on ringing in my mind. Can the sanctioning bit be upgraded to sanctioning even because an airway is directly to the lungs and through the mouth is directly to the stomach.  Can sanctioning be upgraded to even going to the unhidden, to the hidden content? Can you sanction even the hidden content? Then also number two was the improvised sanctioning tools we had. That is the sanctioning tube and the syringe which was used to withdraw the content. Was it effective? Can it be as effective? Like at instances where you don't have a sanctioned tube, can it be effective? Yeah.  And number three, is there any specialized treatment that can be used in cases of emergency to enhance removing content in kids when they have aspirated? Like the help eject, do you administer them intravenously?	summary A child presented with a history of gasping after foreign feeding. Dx: foreign body aspiration. Do: epiglottis.

301	I am a nurse with 15 years of experience in General nursing working in a Sub-county Hospitals and Nursing Homes in Kiambu county in Kenya.   was brought to the hospital by the grandmother, with a complaint of a sudden lower limb weakness. The child had been well all along, eating well, feeding well, no other complaints, but just suddenly could not walk, could not stand. So on arrival to the facility, several tests were run, blood tests were done, and none of them was giving a headway.  So eventually the child didn't have even fever, so the medic who saw the child ended up just giving medications for support of the grandmother who was worried and scared. So they were given medications to be reviewed the following day, of which the following day they still came, and they happened to have met with the staffs from the WHO with a query, a condition called acute flaccid paralysis, that is to rule out polio. So they were looking forward to doing further investigations, of which they took specimens for further analysis.  So eventually, on the history part of it, the grandmother noted that the elder child, an elder sibling also had the same condition, but with time it resolved. So now the question is, how do you handle such kind of a situation where the child just loses mobility, no fever, no infection, nothing is giving headway, but the child is unwell? Number two, when it comes to the family support, the child has been brought to you, you cannot actually put a finger to diagnosis, how do you tell the parent? Because the child comes to the hospital, and for them of course they are at their end, so they come to you as a healthcare worker, and they know you have a solution. So how do you support the family? And also, you cannot just let go that child to go back, so you have to medicate.  So definitely it shows you are giving a medication just blindly, so how do you deal with such kind of a situation? Yeah, so that it doesn't want to feel like even you are defeated. And between that moment and the time you get the results for chemo, because now you are ruling out polio, the specimen has to be taken to chemo, and it takes days. So in between then and getting the results, what do you do for the child?

The vitals were all normal throughout the clinic, but this last time when she was done, she came with very high BPs, generalized body edema. When we did urinalysis, she had urine, protein ++ in urine.  So we definitely diagnosed preeclampsia. It was recently during the doctor's strike. In our facility we had no magnesium sulfate, so we made a very urgent referral.  So she went to a private hospital where she was admitted for a whole week, then she was discharged home, bearing in mind that she was term. So after discharge, she then came back to our facility with the same complaints, and bearing in mind that the doctors were on strike, now we got confused. Now the first question was, how would we help this lady, because seemingly she had trust in us, because we refer her, she comes back to our facility, bearing in mind that the public hospitals were not operating.  Then the question is, what if we lose the mother, we lose the baby, or we lose both in the process of referral.

309	I am a nurse with 14 years of experience in General nursing working in a Dispensaries and Private Clinics in Kiambu county in Kenya.  A man who presented to the facility with complaints of penile discharge, lower abdominal pains, and pain during micturation. We sent him for lab requests, where we did urinalysis. We sent for urinalysis VDRL and PITC, that is HIV testing.  The results came out and it showed that he was with VDRL positive, that is he had syphilis, and also HIV positive. We put him on medication and insisted that he should bring the partners for testing. Now the issue came in when we mentioned that statement and insisted that we should not disclose to his wife that he had syphilis and he was HIV positive.  Now the wife definitely came with the man's card the following day and I recognized the card. On interrogating the wife, the wife had no symptoms, she had no complaints, but we still sent her for the lab requests. The same lab requests, that is urinalysis with VDRL and HIV testing, but they all came out negative.  Fortunately the wife was negative in all the lab requests. Now the main question was, how? How was I going to tackle the case bearing in mind that the husband doesn't want his status to be disclosed to the wife? For one, I didn't want to bring down the marriage because a fight would arise. But then I was wondering, how were they going to live with this man without knowing his status?

Labwork results came back showing VDRL positive for syphilis and HIV positive.put on medication and insisted to bring partner for testing. He refused that the partner have his results disclosed.

Consider ethical pillars - justice, autonomy, beneficence and non-maleficence Balance between patient autonomy and beneficence Respect patient confidentiality and autonomy to not disclose status to the wife In lieu of beneficence, counsel the husband on the importance of disclosing status to the wife Involve a psychologist or counsellor to encourage the husband to disclose. To educate and establish trust between the couple, initiate couple’s therapy For the sake of public health care, counsel the wife on the importance of safe sex practice i.e family planning, contraception, regular testing, use of post and pre exposure prophylaxis without disclosing to her her husband’s status.

310	I am a nurse with 15 years of experience in General nursing working in a Sub-county Hospitals and Nursing Homes in Kiambu county in Kenya.  Still the same patient, the 52 year old male that had been admitted earlier with the diagnosis of persistent malaria, /typhoid and later developed hypertension which was not resolving despite the anti-hypertensives being administered. So on the 5th day the patient had several other tests that were run and among the tests was a discovery of sero-reactive that is HIV positive. So with this new development the patient was off balance and was unable to cope with the news of the new diagnosis and hence the patient became violent, the patient became rude, the patient became uncoperative and could not hold anything.   So the patient could verbalise even the name of the patient or the person who possibly infected him. And now this is the point where we got to know the reason for the persistent malaria, the recurrent malaria, persistent hypertension that was not going down. So it's at this point that we discovered that the patient also had anxiety which also led to the patient's state of mind to an extent that he ended up fighting even the staffs.  So at this point there was a query, are we dealing with a mental case that is a psychotic patient because the patient could not be handled, it was hard to manage and so the patient was referred to Mathare Hospital for the mentally challenged but on arrival they could not admit him there saying that this is not just a mental illness, we first deal with the medical issues before referring the patient back to Mathare and the patient was taken back to the hospital where even the fellow colleagues were fearing to handle him with having a history of being a security personnel, officer, that is the police. So a lot was at stake. Yes now we have come with a conclusive diagnosis, this client is newly diagnosed HIV positive.  So the question is, in such a situation what are you supposed to do? How do you break the news to the patient to ensure that this patient is going to cope and be able to continue with life because eventually we lost that patient, the patient died. So what killed this patient? Is it the hypertension, is it malaria, is it stress? What really killed the patient? What should we do in that situation? Number three, when you have a violent patient, one that you're supposed to administer medication despite the fact yes the patient may be stressed, maybe develops a level of malaria, complications of malaria, is an officer, a policeman whom you don't know whether you will just wake up with a pistol and shoot or whatever the case. Yeah, what is the best way to handle? Should you have security, more security around you as a personnel so that you are able to help this patient?	Summary: 52 year old Male admitted earlier with diagnosis typhoid peritonitis Later developed hypertension. Not resolving despite HTN drugs being given. On the 5th day, patient worsened. Had HTN; patient unable to cope with news and prognosis. Hence became violent; rude, uncooperative & couldn’t eat anything. He verbalized the name of persons who angered him:  Patient has anxiety too. He caught the staff. Referred to welfare but welfare refused and told him to handle the mental case first. Hospital stay was worsened since they heard he is a police guy. Q1: What should the health care provider do? Look for kin and Counsel together. Q2: Patient died - What could have killed the patient? Stress killed the patient together with untreated typhoid, adrenaline and hypertension. Q3:What should we do? Improve on counselling methods of parents. Early recognition of complications  Q4: Best way to handle a violent patient:  Use the existing protocols on handling agitated patient  Sedate. Diagnosis: CVA	SRH

Will she have a ruptured uterus because now the baby cannot come out, she is labouring, she has a scar. So, in the process, we even asked her whether she had money to go to a, because there is a private hospital which is near where we stay because we were looking at the time factor. So we asked her whether they have money, with the relatives who were there.  But fortunately she had money, so we referred her to a private hospital. So now, of which we are not supposed to, in the first place, government should be government to government. So we were asking her, if anything happens, this mother gets a case, and now we have referred her from government to private.  Although as now we are considering now the life of the mother and the baby, and the time. Although we had called an ambulance, obvious, for the government, although we knew now it will take long before it comes. So, the mother fortunately went to a private hospital.  But those are now the questions. If anything happens to this mother, we have not followed the protocol. If this mother dies...	Summary: Underage female presenting in the second stage of labor.

318	I am a nurse with 14 years of experience in General nursing working in a Dispensaries and Private Clinics in Kiambu county in Kenya.  Hello, it's a case of a mother who came to our facility at 28 weeks gestation. She wanted to do ANC profile and start, begin attending clinic at our facility. When we did the profile, she turned out to be HIV, a new case of HIV positive.  Now, upon disclosure, the mother was a single mother. Actually, she is, because she's still gravid. She's a single mother, but she denied the results.  She said that she's not positive, she knows she's not positive, she's not going to take any medication. Actually, she even said that she's no longer going to attend ANC visits. Now, we've tried to send the HTS counsellors to follow her, but she's still adamant that she's not HIV positive.  Now, the question is, what will happen to the child now that the mother has refused to take any medication? What if the mother fails to go to hospital on delivery and has a home delivery? What will happen to the baby? Even after birth, will the mother agree to give the baby medication now that she's even denied to take her own medication? The last question is, what if the child contracts the HIV status? And also, if the mother is going to agree to do expressive breastfeeding, or she's going to do mixed feeding, which will make it easier for the virus to get into the child?	Summary Newly diagnosed gravid mother at 28 weeks gestation. Counsel the mother on compliance and the importance since the mother is reluctant. Benefits of antiretroviral therapy and prevention of mother to child transmission. Counsel the mother on the importance of compliance to antiretroviral therapy. Counsel on benefits to both the mother and child including the reduction of viral load and minimizing transmission to the child. Acknowledge mother's fears in an empathetic way and explore them. Encourage confidentiality and facilitate access and linkage to the mentor. Encourage the mother to continue with routine antenatal visits and monitoring. Advise the mother, once delivery is done and compliance to medication has been achieved, the mother should either exclusively breastfeed the child or feed them on formula. Mixed feeding is not appropriate during the first 6 months due to increased risk of transmission.	MATERNAL

338	I am a nurse with 15 years of experience in General nursing working in a Health centres in Kiambu county in Kenya.  A 26-year-old mother, para 2 plus zero, gravida 3, married, not working, comes to the antenatal clinic, not sure of her dates, since she had been on a family planning method she conceived while having a depo. She's married to a husband who is ailing, has a mental challenge, following a road traffic accident, so has been admitted on and off, now on follow-up at the psychiatric department. So she comes in need of an abdominal ultrasound to enable diagnosing or estimating the estimated date of delivery.  So she has a background of being married with one child, not from that family, so she has one other child with that man, and now pregnant the third time. So she has a complaint and a concern that the family does not like her, and more especially hates the first-born child who is not born of that family. So she raises a concern that even if she calls home, no one would support her in facilitating for the abdominal ultrasound.  So the situation is that we cannot determine when this baby is to be born, and by the look of things, the baby looks big. So the question is, in this kind of a situation, do you wait until when labor strikes, since the mother is not sure of her date when she conceived, and at that moment we are at risk of post-datism, which some mothers may not have spontaneous labor, and if we just assume and say we extract the baby, it could be extract a baby who is preterm. So in such a situation, how do you help in diagnosing where we are, besides estimation of date of delivery, there are so many other things that the abdominal ultrasound would help diagnose any deviation, for example, knowing where the placenta is located.  Then the other question is, now having these socioeconomic challenges, how do you support such a mother? In our own facility, we do not have an ultrasound in a way that you could wave the mother. It happened that even this mother, after being sent to do the ultrasound, she did not go to do the ultrasound, but she comes a few days later to say she has failed to get the money, even for transport. So in such circumstances, do we just sit and wait until the mother's labor comes, or how do you handle that situation?	SUMMARY 26 year old primigravida gravida 3 in antenatal clinic juncture.  Management Examine the mother Measure the fundal height as per examination Review this and the dates that mother felt quickening as this will aid in estimation Enquire the mother required an ultrasound ; consult with gynaecologist for intervention and way forward.

342	I am a nurse with 14 years of experience in General nursing working in a Dispensaries and Private Clinics in Kiambu county in Kenya.  It's a case of pregnant woman who began ANC in our facility. So we moved on swiftly, explaining the details in pregnancy. So at around 2-3 weeks, she was a 3 previous scar.  So we explained to her that at that point we needed to refer her to a gynecologist so that they would move together, because definitely being a 3 previous car, the mode of delivery would be a C.S. The mother was okay with it. We explained the dangers of having a normal delivery, having three other previous scars, and she agreed. Only to see her later, at around 36-38 weeks, she came back to the facility and told us that she didn't need to book a clinic with a gynecologist because she wants to have a vaginal delivery.  She believes that she's going to deliver normally. Even after counseling her, telling her the dangers of doing that, she still insisted that she wouldn't go to book a clinic with a gynecologist. My question is, what is one supposed to do in such a scenario where the mother completely refuses to go, and you very well understand the dangers of what she wants to do, and what if anything happens to her, will you be blamed for anything?	Case summary Patient is a pregnant woman with 3 previous CS scars refusing recommended care despite being counselled and advised on the possible complications that would arise.

This is a teenage girl of 13 years and she has diabetes. So, she came with very high sugars and then she was put on insulin. And then every time the insulin is increased, then the blood sugar is still increasing.  So, we asked the relatives whether they monitor, how she feeds on. And then they said that this girl eats anything. She eats sugar, she eats biscuits, she eats what.  And when she comes to the hospital, she is being explained what she is supposed to eat, but she continues and continues. So, in that case, how do you manage such a teenager who will not adhere to the nutrition concerning the sugar? So, now that insulin is being increased and she is still taking sugars, so how do you manage such a teenager?	Summary A 13 yr old teenage girl has diabetes and is not adherent to change in nutrition that has been advised, yet takes insulin. Blood sugars are not controlled due to lack of avoidance of sugary foods. On inquiry of what she eats, the teenager eats anything  Diagnosis  This is a case of hypoglycemia in this patient with a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, most likely Type 1 complications include diabetic ketoacidosis in this patient due to lack of adequate insulin administration which can eventually tip them into this state. As we know, diabetes is linked with immunosuppression and can lead to recurrent infections in the future  As for management, it is best to sit down and talk to the teenager, assess her psychological state regarding her situation as denial can be an obstacle to compliance with medication . Psychological counselling is recommended. It's important to educate her on complications associated with diabetes. She realises the gravity of the disease.	CHILD_HEALTH
344	I am a nurse with 15 years of experience in General nursing working in a Health centres in Kiambu county in Kenya.  Okay, the mother comes in labour ward in second stage. She's a Para 1, Plus 0, Gravida 2, who has attended clinic once. And on arrival, the mother was assessed and she was fully dilated, ready for delivery.  However, the delivery was a difficult one, since the mother was uncooperative, could not heed to instructions. And eventually, when the baby was delivered, the baby was flat, could not initiate breathing. However, on assessment, the baby had some septic, I don't know whether they are septic spots, but had some broken skin on the arms.  So, with a lot of resuscitation, still the baby did not make it. Question was, what could have happened to the baby's skin? And since the broken skin was on the arms, though you would imagine of maybe the mother trying to secure an abortion, maybe using sharp instrument, that would not make sense. So, the question was, could there have been something done, could there be something that could have been done to save the baby? The other question was, why did the mother come to the hospital late? What could have been the circumstances that led the mother coming to the hospital late? And what measures could have been done to help save the situation?	A baby with rash (Still-birth).  1) What could have happened to the baby’s skin?  It is very common for newborns to develop rash on the skin even shortly after birth. Newborns’ skin peels off after birth too, which could also be mistaken for a rash.  However, there could be many infectious causes too:  Congenital TORCHES syndrome: Toxoplasmosis, Rubella virus, Herpes virus, Cytomegalovirus, and congenital syphilis.   Newborn acne is another cause of babies developing rashes.  Other dermatologic conditions, such as erythema toxicum, can cause rashes.  Allergic reactions could also cause rashes on the baby’s skin.

Is a Para 2, Plus 0, Gravida 3. On assessment, mother diagnosed to be in deep phase of labour. Was admitted and prepared for monitoring of labour.  On the moment for delivery, the mother was taken to the delivery room. And it seemed like the mother was unable to bear with the pain. And just was uncooperative.  Could not settle on the coach. Could not cooperate with the instructions given to help in the delivery of the baby. She would jump onto the coach and jump down, rotate.  Even having the infusion ongoing, would pluck off the giving set, the drip. And everything was just in a mess. It got to a point where now, help could not be possible to administer on this mother.  And finally, the mother had to deliver from the floor. The question is, in such a situation, could there be something that could be done to such kind of situations? Maybe for those mothers who are unable to bear with the pain. Maybe like an analgesic or something that is safe for the mother and safe for the baby.  So that you can have a cooperative mother. And also enable the healthcare worker to give a decent service to the client. And in such a case where the mother is uncooperative, how would you ensure the well-being of the mother and also the well-being of the baby?	Summary A 24 year old Mother, Para 2+0 G3 presents with pain, in an active phase of labor. Was anxious and uncooperative.  Considering non-pharmacological approaches. Breathing techniques; Warm compress and massage. Reassurance in situations where she screams actors and nurses. Pharmacological approach.

348	I am a nurse with 14 years of experience in General nursing working in a Dispensaries and Private Clinics in Kiambu county in Kenya.  I recently had a case of a young mother around 32 years who came to the facility to bring her child for 6 weeks immunization but we insisted that she should start on family planning that's where she gave us history of vaginal bleeding since delivery she said that after delivery the bleeding stopped for 2 weeks and then it returned since then she had been bleeding profusely we did a urinalysis throughout if there could be any infection but there was none we did a speculum inspection to view if there was any goods or anything left during delivery but we couldn't view any so I proceeded and put her the Mirena IUD because we were told that the Mirena works well with hormonal imbalances but after 1 week she returned and told me after the insertion of the Mirena the bleeding only stopped for 2 days then the third day it recurred so now my question was why was the mother bleeding and there was no infection there was no wounds left in the bath canal where was the bleeding coming from how else could I help the mother with the bleeding	SUMMARY 32 old is bleeding 8 weeks postpartum even after having a levonorgestrel intrauterine device inserted.  This is a diagnosis of postpartum hemorrhage. As it is occurring>24 hours after delivery,it is a secondary postpartum hemorrhage. It would be important to do a pelvic ultrasound scan to ensure that there are retained products of conception. A through physical exam would determine there is no tear in the vaginal canal and the cervix .And that there is no thrombus  Coagulation profile should be done to ascertain that there is no coagulopathy as it would lead to heavy bleeding. This patient should also be referred to a gynaecologist for further workup and management	MATERNAL
355	I am a nurse with 15 years of experience in General nursing working in a Sub-county Hospitals and Nursing Homes in Kiambu county in Kenya.  The mother was a known positive, HIV-positive patient, had low HB of 7. Mother progressed safely and had a live male infant who scored well, birth weight of three kilos. After delivery, the mother had minimal bleeding, approximately 150 ml blood loss.  So the mother was stabilized and put into bed for rest. After about 45 minutes, the mother was noted to be restless, yawning and frail. And on assessment, the blood pressure was at 90 over 50.  And there was a pulse rate of 100 BTC. So the mother also had developed breathing difficulties. And diagnosis of postpartum hemorrhage was arrived at.  And therefore, plans to help the mother was underway. So, in such a situation, you look at the blood loss, despite the fact that the definition of postpartum hemorrhage, the risk factors or the parameters are any blood loss that compromises the state of the mother. The normal is from 500 and above, but this one you realize that had a loss of 150, but still went into a compromise.  So, how do you determine who will get into such a situation so that you can prepare yourself early in advance?	Case summary A known positive mother, Hb of 7. Labour progressed safely and had a live male infant who scored well, birth weight of 3 kgs. After delivery, the mother had minimal bleeding, approximately 150 ml of blood loss so she was stabilized and put to rest. After about 45 m minutes, the mother was noted to be restless, yawning and frail. On assessment, the blood pressure was at 90/50 and pulse rate of 100 beats per minute. The mother developed breathing difficulties and a diagnosis of postpartum hemorrhage was given. Estimated blood loss was 150 ml but the mother still developed postpartum hemorrhage.  How do you determine who will get into such situations so that you can prepare early in advance? To anticipate for such scenarios, the patient needs to be on follow up in the antenatal clinic to monitor their progress prior to delivery In this case, the mother had a hemoglobin of 7, therefore her hemoglobin needed to be optimized prior to delivery and the cause of anemia to be ascertained. The mother needed serial monitoring in the ANC cause she is a known positive and has a positive history of low Hb. Anticipate for postpartum hemorrhage given past medical history.	MATERNAL
357	I am a nurse with 14 years of experience in General nursing working in a Dispensaries and Private Clinics in Kiambu county in Kenya.  It is a case of a young mother who brought these small girls, there were two of them, they brought a three-month-old baby with a history of crying a lot at night, irritability. But on examining the child, the child was okay. The abdomen was soft, but we noted that the child was overly wet.  The nappy was wet, the baby shoes were wet. Bearing in mind that it was on a very cold day, the child had very light clothing on. So we asked her whether she got other clothes.  She told us that that's what she dresses the child on a daily basis, very light clothing. So we counseled her on keeping the baby warm, counseled and reassured her on the colic. We diagnosed her with abdominal abdominal colics and gave her infarct counseling on how to take less foods with gas, that is beans.  Then she went home. The following year, she spent home the following day, but the day after tomorrow, we received a call from the referral hospital, that is Gaganya on our part, asking whether she sent me the card. She took a picture of the card and then sent it to me via WhatsApp, asking whether the child was reviewed in our facility.  I told her, yes, we reviewed her, so I gave the details. I asked her, what's the calling? It's because the baby was brought in today in the morning dead. How the presentation was, and the clinician told us that the baby reported that the baby had difficulty in breathing, just difficulty in breathing and fever.  Now my question was, where did we go wrong? How could we have done differently? Maybe we could have saved the baby. Was it a case of misdiagnosis? Could the baby also be suffering from pneumonia or something, but we took it for colics? Did the baby complicate due to the wet clothing that she was wrapped in on that day? We had so many questions, asking ourselves, what if we did anything differently? Maybe we could have saved the child.	Summary: 3 MONTH OLD BOY LOT OF CRYING ALOT, IRRITABILITY (ALSHAMG) THE NEXT DAY presented WITH DIFFICULTY IN BREATHING AND FEVER OVERNIGHT AND ON FOLLOWUP WELL CERTIFIED DIED AT PRESENTATION. The child required more tests at first presentation which would have included lab work like CBC (WBC LYMPHOCYTE), ESR FOR CRP, A CXR WOULD ALSO HAVE BEEN IMPORTANT. The above management would have prompted better follow up. The patient would also have benefited from management in a an in-patient most likely.

Now here we are dealing with a 13 year old girl who is a mother at risk, who never attended any antenatal clinic, there was no history, no booklet presented. So now the question was, even at the point of admission, what could have been the best way to handle this child? Decision whether to take this girl to theatre or just to allow her to have normal delivery, of which after a short while this mother delivered the baby which was good.  Now the question again is, who do you blame? How did this girl get pregnant? Who impregnated this child? Another question is, who do you hold responsible? Is it the mother? Is it the one who impregnated her? Is it her herself? Though her being underage, you may not have had so much to do. And what kind of support would you offer both to the mother and the baby, looking at the mother who is still a young mother?	Summary  A 13 y/o female, pregnant in active phase of labour.

362	I am a nurse with 15 years of experience in General nursing working in a Health centres in Kiambu county in Kenya.  A 22-year-old primi gravida came to the hospital with a post-datism, not in labour, so was admitted for induction of labour, which was commenced at midnight. So the mother slept calmly, no complaints, no pain, no contraction noted. At 6am the mother was examined and she was at 3cm dilated, mild contractions.  The mother was advised to continue ambulating as we monitor for the progress of labour. So at around 11am, another assessment was done, the mother was at 4cm dilated, mild contractions which were on and off. After four other hours, another assessment was done, the mother was still at 4cm dilated, no contraction was palpated.  So the patient was for review, the doctor saw the patient and said that the patient should have rupture of membranes done, and then put on an augmentation with oxytocin. But just before that was done, the mother was noted to have contractions, which were progressing quickly, moderate to strong contractions. So around 2pm the mother had rupture, spontaneous rupture of membranes, took clear like one, but now the contractions were strong, the VE was done, she was 6cm dilated.  So the doctor was called to come and review the patient, and around 4pm the doctor said the patient had been in very very strong contractions, was uncooperative, was jumping up and down with pain, fixing of a cannula was hard. And at that point the baby was noted to have a fetal distress. At the moment the doctor came, the mother was already in second stage, and therefore conducted the delivery, but delivered a poor score, the baby was scored 4, 5, 5. So that was an asphyxiated baby.  The question was, as much as this mother was on induction, which was seeming to be failing at some point, and again, without further intervention, the mother just peaked and had prespitatec labour, which brought to a poor outcome, having a birth asphyxia. Was there something we missed? Was there something that could have been done that was not done? How would you tell when a client is getting into presipitate labour, who goes into presipitate labour, and being a primi gravida? How do you rule out such kind of conditions?	Case summary A 22 year old primigravida presented with postdatism, not in labour. The first indication of labour was at midnight with no pain or contractions. At 6.00 am, the mother had dilated 3 cm with mild contractions. At 11 am, she had dilated 4 cm with mild contractions which are progressing quickly. At 2 pm, there was a rupture of membranes which was clear with strong contractions. A vaginal examination was done while she was 6 cm dilated. At 4 pm, there were very strong contractions but the mother was uncooperative. The baby was noted to be in fetal distress and a cannula was unable to be fixed. The baby was delivered with an APGAR score of 4.5.5.  Diagnosis: Severe birth asphyxia.  Was there a missing gap? How would you tell when a client has precipitated labour?  Management of labour Administer analgesics for pain relief IV access at an early stage Give IV fluids such as normal saline and dextrose 10% Early ambulation to help in contractions Obstetric ultrasound to elicit the weight of the baby which will lead to an early intervention In case the baby is big, prepare of emergency cesarean section Do Full hemograms, Urea Electrolyte Creatinine and urinalysis  The client with precipitated labour- it comes very fast without you knowing and the healthcare giver should be ready at all times for such circumstances	MATERNAL
363	I am a nurse with 15 years of experience in General nursing working in a Dispensaries and Private Clinics in Kiambu county in Kenya.  A 20-year-old mother comes into labour and on admission, the mother did not have a history of antenatal attendance. She said that the booklet got burned in the house. However, the mother was admitted because she was in labour and she progressed well and delivered a live male infant, birth weight of 3 kilograms.   The baby scored well. However, the mother was noted to be distant from the baby, was also discovered not to be breastfeeding the child and she looked distracted, she looked disturbed psychologically. It was also noted that this mother does not have a relative coming to see the mother.   The baby did not have adequate clothes. She had few old clothes which were dressed on the baby. So, having not had no antenatal profile, the mother had to go to the lab and do the baseline tests which she was unable to cater for, which were granted for a waiver and eventually the tests were done.   After that, she was also discharged from the ward and she left for home alone. So, the question is, could there be underlying factors, psychosocial issues with this mother that perhaps could have been missed, seeing that the mother was like she was not ready to deliver, she did not have adequate clothes for the baby, she also was detached from the child. Maybe over and above the medical attention that we offer to the clients, could we be needed to go deeper, to know the patient more clearly or deeply.

She is escorted by her husband, and you suspect gender-based violence. The spouse refuses to leave the room during clerkship, so the patient cannot describe the cause of her bruising. Concern: This patient is concerning for gender-based violence. Management: This requires you to alert the authorities if you have reason to fear for the safety of the patient. It is, however, important to avoid worsening the already bad situation by minimizing confrontation with the husband. Involving a social worker and counselors will aid in confirming or ruling out the suspicions.	SRH

713	I am a nurse working in a Health centres in Kiambu county in Kenya.  Describe the situation, background and the assessment. So, a client comes throug out patient department with complaints of foul-smelling, per viginal discharge. So, she had been treated severally with the foul-smelling discharge, but it was not disappearing.  So, this day she was referred to Family Planning Clinic for screening for CA cervix. And the plan was to do a tissue inspection with acetic acid. On insertion of the speculum, you visualize a mass of tissue, which is the source of the foul-smelling discharge.  Any request or guidance? So, in such a case the question is, how do you disclose the results of what you have visualized? Having visualized an actual diagnosis of cervical cancer, so how do you disclose to the client who had just come for treatment of a foul-smelling discharge that she has cancer of the cervix?	A client comes through the outpatient department with complaints of foul-smelling & per vaginal discharge with a history of seeking treatment severely with no improvement. After screening of cervical cancer, a mass is visualized.  Diagnosis: Cervical cancer is a possible diagnosis in this case since you have brought out the issue of the mass but consider differentials of pelvic inflammatory disease, which presents with post-foul-smelly discharge, trichomoniasis infection. Note these are in view of the post foul-smelly discharge.  Management: The approach to disclosure should always be gentle, factual, and respectful.  It's important to note that diagnosis of cervical cancer is not made via visual inspection by acetic acid. It's made via tissue biopsy of the mass.   Before disclosing the diagnosis, it's wise to do further exclusion.	SRH

The client, who is a 17 year old, when being brought to hospital, she was not told for which service she is going for. But the sister claims she should be given family planning for three years because the college she is in, there is a lot of immorality, and she has become hard-headed, she is not listening to anyone in the family. So the family fears she will get pregnant while in college.  Any request or guidance? So, the question I ask myself is, should you proceed with counselling for family planning, or should you decline to give the service because the client has not consented for it and has no information about it? Another thing is, should we prioritise counselling and not family planning? Would it be giving the wrong care to the client, or would we still be giving the right care for the client?	Summary:  A 17 year old brought to family planning clinic by the sister who is requesting the nurse to give her family planning for 3 years since she is in college. The client is not aware why she is being brought to the hospital. History: The patient was having fever and back pain. She came to the clinic and asked for 3 specimens.   Should I proceed and give the patient the Fp or decline to give it to her because the patient consented?  It is not in order to proceed and give the family planning because the patient has not consented and is under age. b) Talk to Sister on side effect of family planning and also she should be aware that some diseases will be contracted even with family planning. She should just talk with her sister on importance of abstinence and condom use.	SRH
