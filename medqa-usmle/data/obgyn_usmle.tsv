A 31-year-old G1P0000 presents to the obstetric service for a scheduled induction of labor at 39 weeks due to poorly controlled gestational diabetes. Her pregnancy was largely uncomplicated aside from abnormal 1-hour and 3-hour glucose tolerance tests, for which diet and lifestyle management were initially recommended. Due to poor glycemic control despite these interventions, the patient was started on insulin. Postprandial glucose levels were in the 170-180 mg/dL range throughout the remainder of her pregnancy. She has a family history of diabetes in her mother and grandmother, as well as hypertension in her father and preeclampsia in her sister. The patient had an appropriate weight gain of 26 pounds during this pregnancy, with a pre-pregnancy BMI of 22.4 kg/m^2. At her last ultrasound one month ago, the estimated fetal weight was 4,100 g, and upon arrival on the labor floor, the updated measurement is 4,560 g. The patient continues to desire a vaginal delivery and is subsequently induced. After 24 hours, the infant’s head delivers but the shoulders do not. The mother’s hips are flexed and pressure is applied to the suprapubic region without improvement, and internal rotation is ultimately required to deliver a male infant after 3 minutes. One hour after delivery, the infant is found to have an absent Moro reflex on the left side. He is shown in Figure A.

You are a resident in the surgical ICU. One of the patients you are covering is a 35-year-old pregnant G1P0 in her first trimester admitted for complicated appendicitis and awaiting appendectomy. Your attending surgeon would like you to start the patient on moxifloxacin IV preoperatively.

You know that there are potentially safer antibiotics, such as piperacillin/tazobactam, which is in Pregnancy Category B. What should you do?	"A. Administer piperacillin/tazobactam instead of moxifloxacin without discussing with the attending since your obligation is to ""first, do no harm"" and both are acceptable antibiotics for complicated appendicitis. | B.
